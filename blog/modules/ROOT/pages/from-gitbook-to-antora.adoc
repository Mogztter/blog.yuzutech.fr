As you may already know, the new version of {uri-gitbook-drop-asciidoc}[GitBook has dropped support for AsciiDoc].
And since you're here, you probably enjoy writing documentation in _AsciiDoc_ and you want to keep using it!
I have good news for you and it's called _Antora_.

== Antora

{uri-antora}[Antora] is a documentation site generator and _AsciiDoc_ is Antora's native content markup language.
{uri-opendevise}[OpenDevise], the company behind _Antora_, is also actively working on _Asciidoctor_, the reference implementation of the AsciiDoc syntax.

In other words, the _AsciiDoc_ syntax is a first class citizen in _Antora_ and _Asciidoctor_ is used at its full potential.

Without further ado, let's migrate from GitBook to Antora!

== Documentation component and modules

[%hardbreaks]
A collection of documentation files organized under Antora's {uri-antora-structure}[standard project structure] is called a _documentation component_.
In Antora's terminology, a GitBook corresponds to a single documentation component in a single git repository.
So the first thing you will need to do is to create a {uri-antora-component}[documentation component] named `book` with a {uri-antora-module}[module] named `ROOT`.

[NOTE]
====
Here the module named `ROOT` will contain everything,
but depending on your use case you could create as many modules (or documentation components) as you want.
====

. Create the structure

 $ mkdir -p book/modules/ROOT/pages

. Move every *.adoc file to [.path]_pages_

 $ mv *.adoc book/modules/ROOT/pages

If you have images, attachments or videos, you will need to create the following subdirectories in your module:

* [.path]_assets/attachments_
* [.path]_assets/images_
* [.path]_assets/videos_

And here's the complete tree structure:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ book
    â””â”€â”€ modules
        â””â”€â”€ ROOT
            â”œâ”€â”€ assets
            â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ attachments
            â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ images
            â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ videos
            â””â”€â”€ pages

8 directories
```

If your book is structured in chapters, you do not necessarily need to create a module for each chapter.
You can instead create `'topic`' subfolders in the [.path]_pages_ directory.

Next, we need to describe our documentation component.

== Component descriptor

A documentation component must contain a {uri-antora-component-descriptor}[component descriptor] file named `antora.yml`.

So let's create a file named `antora.yml` in the [.path]_book/_ directory:

.book/antora.yml
```yml
name: book
title: Book
version: 'latest'
start_page: ROOT:overview.adoc
```

The keys and values are pretty much self explanatory.
Our component will be named `book`, its title will be `Book` and its version will be `latest`.

We also explicitly define the start page.
By default, Antora looks for a file named `index.adoc` in the `ROOT` module.
So if your start page is already named `index.adoc`, you can remove the `start_page` key.

[NOTE]
====
The name of the component is determined from the `name` key in the component descriptor.
In this migration guide, the component root directory is named `book` but this does not affect the name of the component (defined in the component descriptor file).
====

Check out the {uri-antora-component-descriptor}[component description documentation] to learn more.

== Playbook

GitBook allows you to customize your book using a configuration file named `book.json`. +
Similarly, Antora uses a {uri-antora-playbook}[playbook file] to control
what content is included in your site,
what user interface (UI) is applied to it,
and where the site is published. +
Playbooks can be written in YAML, JSON, and TOML.

In the following examples, we will be using YAML (but you're free to use JSON or TOML):

== Content

In the previous section we've created a documentation component called `book`.
The next step is to register this documentation component in our playbook.

. Create a file named `antora-playbook.yml` at the root of your git repository:
+
.antora-playbook.yml
```yml
content:
  sources:
  - url: .
    start_path: book
```

Since we are working with a local repository we are using the value dot (`.`). +
The path will be resolved relative to the location of the playbook file.

The `start_path` value points to our documentation component located in the `book` directory (and also named `book`).

[NOTE]
====
For ease of migration, this guide is recommending a particular very simple, but restrictive, layout in a single git repository.
In a playbook `sources` entry, there are two keys expressing the relationship between the playbook, the git repository of the source, and the location of the component descriptor.
For a local repository, the `url` will be the path from the playbook to the root of the git repository.
The `start_path` is the path from the root of the git repository to the `antora.yml` component descriptor.
====

== Attributes

The `attributes` key in your playbook file can be used to define global (i.e. site-wide) AsciiDoc document attributes.

.antora-playbook.yml
```yml
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    spark-version: '2.1.0'
    sourcedir: 'src/main/scala'
```

== Google Analytics

Antora has built-in support for Google Analytics.
To enable it, you will need to configure your key in `site.keys.google_analytics`.

.antora-playbook.yml
```yml
site:
  keys:
    google_analytics: 'UA-86782445-4'
```

== Navigation

With Antora, you can create your site's navigation with AsciiDoc and store it right alongside your documentation files.

GitBook uses a `SUMMARY.adoc` file to define the structure of chapters and subchapters of the book.
Here's an example:

```adoc
= Summary

. link:part1/README.adoc[Part I]
.. link:part1/writing.adoc[Writing is nice]
.. link:part1/antora.adoc[Antora is nice]
. link:part2/README.adoc[Part II]
.. link:part2/feedback_please.adoc[We love feedback]
.. link:part2/better_tools.adoc[Better tools for authors]
```

In Antora, you need to define the key `nav` in the `antora.yml` file:

. Edit the file `antora.yml` in the [.path]_book/_ directory:
+
.book/antora.yml
```yml
name: book
title: Book
version: 'latest'
start_page: ROOT:overview.adoc
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
```
+
The `nav` key accepts a list of navigation files.
Each value specifies the path to a navigation file (e.g., modules/module-name/nav.adoc).
The order of the values dictates the order the contents of the navigation files are assembled in the published component menu.
+
. Create a file named `nav.adoc` in the [.path]_book/modules/ROOT_ directory:
+
.book/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
```adoc
.xref:index.adoc[In-module page]
* xref:a-page-in-this-module.adoc[Another in-module page]
** xref:another-page.adoc#and-fragment[An in-module page deep link]
* xref:topic/page.adoc[In-module page in a topic folder]
```

== Links between pages

If you use the published URL in your links, I would recommend to start using cross-references.
In Antora, you can create a link between pages using the `xref` macro.
For instance, to create a link to a page in the same module, you should use:

```adoc
xref:error-handling.adoc[Error Handling]
```

And here's the syntax to create a link to a page in a topic folder:

```adoc
xref:concept/index.adoc[Key Concepts]
```

As we've seen before images are stored in a directory named [.path]_assets/images_.
To insert an image, we need to use the AsciiDoc block image macro (`image::[]`).
Let's say we have an image called _pipeline-workflow.png_ in [.path]_assets/images_.
Here's the syntax to add it to a page.

```adoc
image::pipeline-workflow.png[a diagram illustrating the pipeline stages]
```

As you can see, we don't need to use a relative path or to define the `imagesdir`.
So in most cases, you should be able to simplify the path to your linked resources.

== Example

We will be using the "Spark Streaming Notebook" as an example.
The source code of this book is available on GitHub: https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-streaming-notebook

Here's the `book.json` file:

.book.json
```json
{
  "structure": {
    "readme": "book-intro.adoc"
  },
  "variables": {
    "spark.version": "2.1.0",
    "sourcedir": "src/main/scala"
  },
  "plugins": ["ga"],
  "pluginsConfig": {
    "ga": {
      "token": "UA-86782445-4"
    }
  }
}
```

And here's the equivalent configuration in Antora:

.antora-playbook.yml
```yml
site:
  title: Spark Streaming
  url: https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/spark-streaming-notebook
  start_page: book::intro.adoc
  keys:
    google_analytics: 'UA-86782445-4'
content:
  sources:
  - url: .
    start_path: book
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    spark-version: '2.1.0'
    sourcedir: 'src/main/scala'
```

== Generate your site

To get you started quickly, Antora provides a default UI.
To use it, edit your `antora-playbook.yml` file and add the following content:

.antora-playbook.yml
```yml
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
```

Then, configure the output directory to define where the generated site will be published.
Again, edit your `antora-playbook.yml` file and add the following content:

.antora-playbook.yml
```yml
output:
  dir: ./public
```

We're almost done.
If that's not already the case, please {uri-antora-install}[install Antora] on your machine.
Then, open a terminal and type:

 $ antora antora-playbook.yml

Your site should be generated in the `public/` directory ðŸš€
