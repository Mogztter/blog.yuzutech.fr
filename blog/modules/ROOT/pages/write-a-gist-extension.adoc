:description: Extensions are central to the success of Asciidoctor because they open up the language to new use cases. \
Asciidoctor.js allows extensions to be written using the full power of the JavaScript language. \
Let's find out how we can use an extension to embed a gist into our documentation.

Asciidoctor.js offers a list of extension points that open up the language to new use cases.
The following extension points are currently available:

Preprocessor::
Processes the raw source lines before they are passed to the parser.

Tree processor::
Processes the Asciidoctor.Document (AST) once parsing is complete.

Postprocessor::
Processes the output after the document has been converted, but before it's written to disk.

Docinfo Processor::
Adds additional content to the header or footer regions of the generated document.

Block processor::
Processes a block of content marked with a custom block style (i.e., `[custom]`).

Block macro processor::
Registers a custom block macro and processes it (e.g., `gist::12345[]`).

Inline macro processor::
Registers a custom inline macro and processes it (e.g., `btn:[Save]`).

Include processor::
Processes the `include::<filename>[]` directive.

In this article we are going to use a _Block macro processor_ named `gist`. +
To register an extension, it's recommended to create a dedicated registry.
We can then enable the registry using the `extension_registry` option.

```js
const registry = asciidoctor.Extensions.create() // <1>
/*
 * A block macro that embeds a Gist into the output document
 * Usage: gist::12345[]
 */
registry.blockMacro(function () { // <2>
  const self = this
  self.named('gist')
  self.process(function (parent, target, attrs) {
    const titleHTML = attrs.title ? `<div class="title">${attrs.title}</div>\n` : ''
    const html = `<div class="openblock gist">
  ${titleHTML}<div class="content">
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/${target}.js"></script>
  </div>
</div>`
    return self.createBlock(parent, 'pass', html, attrs, {})
  });
});
const options = { extension_registry: registry } // <3>
const result = asciidoctor.convert('gist::4b44db7b60724ceb3d969a449f30a48a[]', options)
```
<1> Create a `registry`
<2> Register the gist extension
<3> Define the `extension_registry` option (the gist extension will be enabled)

In you document you can now reference a Gist using the syntax `gist::12345[]`. +
And here's the result with for `gist::4b44db7b60724ceb3d969a449f30a48a[]`

gist::4b44db7b60724ceb3d969a449f30a48a[]

[NOTE]
====
It's also possible to register an extension globally using `asciidoctor.Extensions.register`:

```js
asciidoctor.Extensions.register(function () {
  this.blockMacro(function () { /* ... */ })
})
```

In this case you don't need to specify the `extension_registry` option since the extension will be enabled globally. +
To unregister all the extensions, you can use `asciidoctor.Extensions.unregisterAll()` function.
