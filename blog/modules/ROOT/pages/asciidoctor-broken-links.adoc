One of the most frustrating experiences for a reader is broken links.
Using a https://opendevise.com/blog/referencing-pages/[good site generator] can help but what about external links ? +
How do you make sure that all the external links in your documentation still work ?

With Asciidoctor.js, you can enable a catalog using the `catalog_assets` option.
Once this option is enabled, the processor will capture every links found in your document, and store them in the catalog. +
For reference, the parser will also capture footnotes, images, index terms, cross-references and ids. But let's focus on links for now.

Here's an example where `catalog_assets` is enabled:

[source,js]
----
include::example$broken-links/main.js[tags=convert]
----
<1> Enable the `catalog_assets` option
<2> Convert the document because links will only be available after the document has been converted
<3> Return an `Array` of links found in the document

Now that we have all the links present in our document, we can make sure that every one of them is still working. +
To do that we should probably use a library but here's a naive implementation to give you an idea.

Here, we are using the `http` and `https` module from Node.js to make sure that the server does not return a `4xx` or `5xx` errors for the URL:

[source,js]
----
include::example$broken-links/main.js[tags=check-http]
----
<1> The server returns an error code `4xx` or `5xx`
<2> The status code is (considered) valid
<3> The client returns an error (most likely because the server is nonexistent)

[NOTE]
====
We are not using `reject` because we want all the promises to be resolved (ie. we don't want to stop at the first failure).
====

We also define a function to check if a file exists:

[source,js]
----
include::example$broken-links/main.js[tags=check-file]
----
<1> Use https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_stat_path_options_callback[`stat`] to make sure that the file exists

And finally, we iterate on each link:

[source,js]
----
include::example$broken-links/main.js[tags=check-all]
----
<1> Parse the link
<2> If the protocol is `http:` or `http:`, use the `checkHttpLink` function
<3> If the protocol is `file:`, normalize the path and use the `checkFileLink` function
<4> If the protocol is `undefined`, use the `checkFileLink` function
<5> If the protocol is unsupported, return an error
<6> Check if there's one or more errors
<7> Exit the program with the return code 1

And here's the output of this program:

```
Found a broken link: subdir/bar.pdf - Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'subdir/bar.pdf'
Found a broken link: quz.pdf - Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'quz.pdf'
Found a broken link: https://antoraa.org - Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND antoraa.org antoraa.org:443
Found a broken link: https://asciidoctor.org/doc - Status code is: 404
```
