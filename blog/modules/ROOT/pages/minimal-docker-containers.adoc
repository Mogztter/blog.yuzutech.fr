It's a common best practice in the Docker community to keep containers as small as possible.
There are a few reasons for this:

* small images are faster to copy around,
* they are faster to start,
* by removing unnecessary components from your image, you reduce the attack surface.

While working on https://kroki.io[Kroki^], one of my goal was to build minimal containers.
To give you a bit of context, Kroki provides a unified API on top of more than a dozen diagrams libraries.
And as you might have guessed, each diagram library has specific requirements and runtime!
As a matter of fact, they are written in various programming language: Haskell, Go, Java, Node.js, Python...

== Action plan

I took the following approach:

. create an image from {uri-docker-scratch}[scratch^] (literally `FROM scratch`).
. build a statically linked binary (for each diagram library) that can run on top of _scratch_!

In this article, I will describe a few tools and techniques I've discovered along the way.
Let's start with the easiest first!

== Haskell

For reference, I've never written a single line of Haskell and I'm not familiar with the Haskell ecosystem.
But surprisingly, it was relatively easy to create a statically linked binary thanks to this {uri-blog-static-haskell}[great article by Vaibhav Sagar^].

One thing led to another, https://github.com/nh2[Niklas Hamb√ºchen^] and https://github.com/mmzx[Akos Marton^] helped me to setup an even easier build based on _Stack_.

My goal here was to build a statically linked binary of {uri-gh-erd}[Erd^].
If you don't know this utility, it can translate a plain text description of a relational database schema to a graphical entity-relationship diagram.
The visualization is produced by using dot from _GraphViz_.

Starting with Docker 17.05, we can use {uri-docker-multi-stage}[multi-stage build^].
Basically, we can use different base images, and each of them begins a new stage of the build.

In our case, we will define two steps:

- The first step will use an Ubuntu image to build the project and create a static binary using _stack_.
- The second step will copy the static binary built at the first step in a _scratch_ image.

[source,dockerfile]
----
include::example$minimal-docker/erd.Dockerfile[]
----

And here's the result, a 21 MB image:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY         TAG           SIZE
scratch-erd        latest        21MB
----

For reference, here's the size of the `haskell:8` image:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY         TAG           SIZE
haskell            8.8.3         1.47GB
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note that, in this specific example, the GraphViz library is still required at runtime.

To workaround this issue, we could instead use an https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine[Alpine^] base image and install GraphViz using `RUN apk add --update --no-cache graphviz`.
====

== Rust

Stefan Seemayer describes in a blog post {uri-blog-static-rust}[how to statically compile an 'Hello World' server in Rust^].
In this article, Stefan is _not_ using a multi-stage build.
Instead, the current working directory is mapped into the container:

 $ alias rust-musl-builder='docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/home/rust/src ekidd/rust-musl-builder'
 $ rust-musl-builder cargo build --release

To be consistent, we will use the `ekidd/rust-musl-builder` image in a multi-stage build:

[source,dockerfile]
----
include::example$minimal-docker/svgbob.Dockerfile[]
----

Nothing fancy here, we are using the `cargo` command line to install a pre-built binary of `svgbob` from https://crates.io/crates/svgbob_cli[crates.io^].

And here's the result, a 4 MB image:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY        TAG       SIZE
scratch-svgbob    latest    4.01MB
----

== Go

It comes at no surprise that someone already wrote a great blog post on {uri-blog-static-go}[how to create the smallest Golang Docker image^].
In this blog post, Cyrille Hemidy, points out that the _official_ Docker image for Go is 779 MB!

Here, we're using the same approach described above with a multi-stage build:

[source,dockerfile]
----
include::example$minimal-docker/kroki.Dockerfile[]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Go < 1.10, dont forget to add `CGO_ENABLED=0` otherwise you will get the following error when trying to run the binary:

[source]
----
standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
----

This obscure message means that a dynamic library is missing because the binary is not statically linked.
====

And here's the result, from 779 MB to less than 10 MB:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY         TAG           SIZE
scratch-kroki      latest        8.91MB
----

== Node.js

As we've seen above, building a statically linked binary is relatively easy in an Haskell, Rust or Go ecosystem.
But what about Node.js?

Thanks to https://github.com/zeit/pkg[pkg^], it's possible to package a Node.js application into an executable that can be run even on containers without Node.js installed.

[source,dockerfile]
----
include::example$minimal-docker/nomnoml.Dockerfile[]
----

In the example above, we are using `pkg` to create a binary from the https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml[Nomnoml^] diagram library but the logic can be applied to almost any Node.js project.
As you can see, we get the sources from GitHub, then we install the dependencies using `npm i`, and finally we execute the `pkg` command line to produce a binary named `nomnoml.bin` from the `dist/nomnoml-cli.js` file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please note that the binary is not statically linked. If you run `ldd` on the binary you will get:

[source,console]
----
$ ldd /nomnoml/nomnoml.bin
	/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 (0x7fc3d3bc4000)
	libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x7fc3d168a000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x7fc3d1676000)
	libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 => /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 (0x7fc3d3bc4000)
----

That's why we are not building the image `FROM scratch` but `FROM alpine:3.11` to make sure that the system shared libraries will be available and compatible.
====

And here's the result:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY         TAG           SIZE
alpine-nomnoml     latest        50.9MB
----

That's still not bad for an Alpine based image.
For reference, the builder base image `node:12.16.2-alpine3.11` (also based on Alpine) is about 90MB.

== Java

With https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM^] and https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] it's now possible to build native images that generate a native binary but it has a few https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md[limitations^].
If you can, you should definitely build a native binary but if you cannot then one solution is to use Alpine as a base image.

=== Alpine Linux

The main benefit is that Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.
But the main caveat is that it does use http://www.musl-libc.org/[musl libc^] instead of http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html[glibc and friends^], so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements.
However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. +

Keep in mind that, since Alpine is not officially supported, the OpenJDK organization on Docker only publish Early Access versions of the JDK on Alpine.
So, if you want to use a stable version of the JDK, you should instead use the Docker images produced by the https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK^] organization.

They come in two flavors, a "slim" JDK image and and JRE image, both based on Alpine:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY                    TAG                          SIZE
adoptopenjdk/openjdk11        jre-11.0.6_10-alpine         147MB
adoptopenjdk/openjdk11        jdk-11.0.6_10-alpine-slim    253MB
----

For comparison, here's an image based on Ubuntu Bionic and another one based on Debian Buster "slim":

[source]
----
REPOSITORY            TAG                            SIZE
adoptopenjdk          13.0.2_8-jre-hotspot-bionic    225MB
openjdk               11.0.6-jre-slim-buster         204MB
----

As you can see, they are relatively small and the image based on Alpine Linux is "only" 27% smaller.
At the same time, if you are using a JRE instead of a JDK on Alpine Linux, you will get a 40% smaller image.

=== jlink

I'm not using `jlink` (yet) but this tool, introduced in JDK 9, can be used to create a custom runtime image where only the required Java modules are included.
Combined with a multi-stage build, it's possible to build a smaller runtime for your Java application.

=== fat-jar

Since my application is relatively lightweight, I've decided to use a single executable jar that contains all my dependencies (also known as "fat-jar").
As a result, the Dockerfile is really straightforward:

[source,dockerfile]
----
include::example$minimal-docker/java.Dockerfile[]
----

This approach is also useful because the application can be executed outside of Docker using the same command line: `java -jar kroki-server.jar`.

[NOTE]
====
Using a single executable jar is convenient but it's not the most optimal because the entire application is build as a single image layer.
So even when you change a single line of your code, the entire application layer will be rebuilt.

If you are building an application with a lot of dependencies (and your build is slow), you should try https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[jib^].
====

== Summary

The size of your Docker images matters but it should not be the only deciding factor.
For instance, you don't want to spend days or weeks trying to make your application work on Alpine.
If your application is working fine on Debian, then use a minimal base image and carefully add additional packages.

You should also think about security.
While it's true that by removing unnecessary components from your image, you reduce the attack surface,
it is also true that it's safer to use an active and well-maintained base image with security updates rather than a less reliable but smaller base image.

And finally, you should think about troubleshooting.
If you cannot execute an interactive shell on the container (because you don't even have one installed!) then it will be really hard to troubleshoot a problem.

So the smallest image possible is not always the best solution!
